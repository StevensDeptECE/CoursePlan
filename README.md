# CoursePlan
An open source project to plan courses.
Right now on a crude global map, but later perhaps supporting zooming into local regional maps

Current Features
1. Works in English and Chinese
2. Save a list of waypoints
3. Edit waypoints by typing in coordinates or dragging them on screen

Desired Features
4. Add vector currents and winds to show forecast conditions along the way
5. Support vessel speed and vector currents to estimate time required for journey
6. Support different kind of vehicles
   a. land (only accept waypoints on land)
   b. water (only accepts waypoints on water)
   c. air (either)
7. Load in charts in digital format

Hopefully future students will be adding these and more features to what is already a beautiful little program!
